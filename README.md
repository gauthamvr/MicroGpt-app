# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).
To use this project for yourself, you may have to create a backend and database, preferably in Neondb.

## Download the app
## Android

 [Get in on Google play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anonymous.MicroGpt)

## Get started with development


1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo run:android
   ```



The app would start in an emulator or on your physical device based on your configuration.
Note: You need to set up server and database for the app to function.



You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
