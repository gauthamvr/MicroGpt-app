# Welcome to your MicroGpt app ðŸ‘‹
Offline AI chat on your device. Private, customizable, and open source. Create unique AI characters and chat without needing the internet.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).
To use this project for yourself, you may have to create a backend and database, preferably in Neondb.

MicroGPT brings the power of AI offline chat right to your device. 
## Features
- Offline AI Chat Anytime, Anywhere: Download or load small language models directly to your phone. Chat privately without needing a constant internet connection.
- Create Unique AI Characters: Craft intelligent personalities with distinct traits. Share them with others or keep them for yourselfâ€”without exposing their inner logic.
- Your Data Stays Yours: All chat history is saved locally on your device. 
- Build and Share Effortlessly: Design, store, and share your favourite AI characters with ease.
- Access Powerful Models Easily: Load models from your device or browse and download from Hugging Faceâ€”your gateway to a vast library of AI models.
