<h1>Privacy Policy for MicroGPT</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to MicroGPT (the “App”), published by
  <strong>MeteorMeta</strong>. This Privacy Policy outlines how we may
  collect, use, share, and protect information obtained from users of
  our App. By accessing or using the App, you agree to the practices
  described in this policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use
  of the App.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We May Collect</h2>
<p>
  The App may collect or receive certain types of information, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account Details:</strong> Information you provide when
    creating an account or signing in (such as email address, display
    name, username, or bio).</li>
  <li><strong>User-Generated Content:</strong> Content created, uploaded,
    or submitted within the App, including character
    definitions, or other materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Non-personal information about how you
    interact with the App (e.g., access times, error logs) to improve
    performance and user experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>
  We may use the information we collect for purposes such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Operating and maintaining the App’s core features and services.</li>
  <li>Enabling user profile, character functionality (e.g., displaying usernames,
    bios, or public content).</li>
  <li>Enhancing, personalizing, and improving the App based on aggregate
    usage patterns.</li>
  <li>Communicating about updates, security alerts, or other
    administrative matters.</li>
  <li>Analyzing performance and troubleshooting technical issues.</li>
  <li>Complying with applicable laws or legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Public Content</h2>
<p>
  Some features of the App allow you to mark certain content (e.g.,
  character definitions) as public. Public content may be visible to
  other users, along with a username or other identifiers. When you choose
  to make content public, you acknowledge that it can be seen and accessed
  by others. Exercise caution when sharing any information that you
  consider sensitive.
</p>

<h2>4. Local Storage of Chats</h2>
<p>
  The App may allow you to download or load models onto your device and
  conduct chats. In such cases, the chat data generally remains
  stored locally on your device unless you choose to share it or upload
  it. We do not routinely collect or store such chat data on our servers.
</p>

<h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
  The App may integrate or rely on third-party services for certain
  functionalities, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication Providers (e.g., Clerk):</strong>
    Handling user sign-in and account verification.</li>
  <li><strong>Model Hosting Platforms (e.g., Hugging Face):</strong>
    Enabling you to browse or download language models from external
    sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  These third parties operate under their own terms and privacy policies.
  We do not control or assume responsibility for their practices. Please
  review their policies if you have concerns about how they handle your
  data.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Security and Retention</h2>

<p>
  We retain collected information only as long as it is needed for
  operational purposes or as required by law. When no longer required,
  we take steps to remove or anonymize such information. You may request account
  deletion at any time, which will remove your personal data from our
  database, subject to any legal obligations we may have to keep it.
</p>

<h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
  Our App is not directed at individuals under the age of 13. We do not
  knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you
  believe we may have inadvertently collected such information, please
  contact us so we can take appropriate measures to remove it.
</p>

<h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
  The App is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of
  any kind, either express or implied. You agree that your use of the App
  is at your own risk. We disclaim liability for any damages resulting
  from your use of (or inability to use) the App, and for any user content
  you create, share, or download.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy at our discretion to reflect changes
  in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons.
  Any changes will become effective when we post the revised policy. Your
  continued use of the App signifies your acceptance of these updates, so
  please check this page periodically.
