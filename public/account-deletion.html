<h1>Delete Your MicroGPT Account</h1>

<p>
  This page explains how you can request deletion of your MicroGPT
  account and the associated data. MicroGPT is published by
  <strong>MeteorMeta</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By following the
  steps below, you can permanently remove your data from our systems.
</p>

<h2>1. Data We Remove Upon Deletion</h2>
<p>
  When you request an account deletion, we will remove:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your user identifier (username or name)</li>
  <li>Your email address and display name</li>
  <li>Any optional bio information you have provided</li>
  
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> If we are required by law or for legitimate
  business needs (e.g., security or fraud prevention) to retain certain
  minimal data, we will do so in compliance with applicable regulations
  but will promptly delete any data no longer necessary.
</p>

<h2>2. How to Request Account Deletion</h2>
<p>
  If you wish to delete your MicroGPT account, please follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Send an email to
    <a href="mailto:meteormeta.dev@gmail.com">meteormeta.dev@gmail.com</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the subject line, include:
    <strong>“MicroGPT Account Deletion Request.”</strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    In the body of the email, provide:
    <ul>
      <li>The email address associated with your MicroGPT account</li>
      <li>Your randomly generated username, if available</li>
      <li>Any additional details that can help us confirm your identity
        (for security)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  We will confirm your request within a reasonable timeframe and proceed
  to delete your account and associated data. Once deleted, your account
  will no longer be accessible, and the deletion process cannot be reversed.
</p>

<h2>3. Retention After Deletion</h2>
<p>
  We strive to delete all personal data related to your account promptly
  once your request has been verified. However, we may retain a minimal
  amount of data if legally required or for legitimate interests such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fraud detection and prevention</li>
  <li>Addressing security or technical issues</li>
  <li>Complying with legal obligations (e.g., records required by law)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Any data retained for these reasons will be stored securely and
  deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary.
</p>

  we respect your choice and will do our best to ensure your data is
  removed in a timely and compliant manner.
